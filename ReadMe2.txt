1- File->open train file efficiency
2- choose the distance normally ED
3- choose the split ratio to split the test set from the training set randomly 
4- choose from the main menu: TrainFurthestP BST
5- choose from the main menu: Test FurthestP BST

Data file must be text dilimited by space, if the class in the first row check "class column at1st"

you may use other algorithms as well, I will tell you later to which paper you refer to, as each method has its own paper.

yo use n-fold:
1- open the source code under Tree2Rndpnt, the "test all with n-fold efficient", uncomment which method you want an comment the other methods.
complie
in the run mode, choose the wanted n-fold and click Tree2Rndpnt, then "test all with n-fold efficient"

collect the results in the text boxes
